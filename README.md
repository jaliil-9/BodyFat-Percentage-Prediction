# Body Fat Percentage Prediction using Decision Tree Regression
This project aims to predict the body fat percentage of a person using a decision tree regression model on Google Colaboratory. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, and it contains information about the body fat percentage of a group of individuals along with their age, weight, height, and various body circumference measurements.

# About me

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and used for training and testing the model.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed on the dataset to gain insight into the data and eliminate any features that did not have a strong relationship with the target. Heatmap correlation and scatter plots were used for this purpose.

# Model Building and Evaluation
A decision tree regression model was built using the preprocessed dataset. The model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on the remaining data. The evaluation on the test data produced an r2 score of 0.982, demonstrating the high accuracy of the model in predicting body fat percentage.

# Conclusion
This project shows that a decision tree regression model can be used to predict body fat percentage with a high degree of accuracy. The model can be used in various applications, such as fitness and health monitoring, to help individuals maintain a healthy lifestyle.
